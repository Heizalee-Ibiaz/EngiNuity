# EngiNuity
EngiNuity is an educational mobile application that includes lectures, quizzes, and gamesâ€”all related to the lessons. It was built using MIT App Inventor as a requirement for my Midterm exam, focusing solely on subjects I took in college. The purpose of this project is to explore and apply various features of MIT App Inventor.
